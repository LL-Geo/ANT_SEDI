![SSB_likelihood](/Figure/figure2/Fig2.png?raw=true "Title")

This repository contain R notebook to map subglacial sedimentary basin distribution in Antarctica using Random Forest, and Hydro-mechanical model to simulate groundwater flow with ice sheet advance and retreat.

The sedimentary basin likelihood map is located in [Result](https://github.com/LL-Geo/ANT_SEDI/blob/main/Result/SSB_Likelihood.tif).
