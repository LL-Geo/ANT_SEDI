This repository contain R notebook to map subglacial sedimentary basin distribution in Antarctica using Random Forest, and Hydro-mechanical model to simulate groundwater flow with ice sheet advance and retreat.

The sedimentary basin likelihood map is located in [Result](https://github.com/LL-Geo/ANT_SEDI/blob/main/Result/SSB_Likelihood.tif).

This 10 km resolution map is reported in Antarctic Polar Stereographic projection with latitude of true scale at -71 degrees south; the origin (0,0) km at South Pole; Positive Y-axis along 0 degree longitude; Positive X-axis along 90 degree East longitude.
